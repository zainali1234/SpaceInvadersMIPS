## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following tools installed before running the game:

MIPS emulator
Appropriate MIPS assembly compiler/assembler

## Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mips-space-invader.git
cd mips-space-invader
```
Open the MIPS assembly file in your preferred editor or development environment.
Compile the assembly code using your MIPS assembler:

## Example using SPIM
```
spim -file space_invader.asm
```
